      <p>Dear Orioles,</p>

      <p>
       I am writing to let you know that after more than 15 years as a loyal Baltimore Orioles season ticket holder, I have decided not to renew my membership. This was not an easy decision, but several changes this year have made it difficult to continue:
Seat Relocation – I have enjoyed my seats for over five years. This year I am being required to move, likely out of my current section and area. 
Increased Minimum Game Package – The 13-game plan was perfect for my dad and me. At 80 years old, he was able to attend most of those games. A 20-game plan, however, is not manageable for him (or myself). 
Parking Restrictions – Losing access to Lot B/C is a significant concern. Even if this policy might change later, I cannot risk it. My dad cannot walk long distances, and nearby parking was essential for us.
Ticket Price Increase – While the increase per game may seem small, requiring seven additional games makes the overall cost much higher.
      </p>
      
<p>
1. Beyond these points, I have also felt over time that loyal 13-game members have lost many benefits, including:
2. Removal of member meet-and-greet sessions with representatives
3. Elimination of beer discounts, which are already among the highest in Major League Baseball
4. Shifting all changes online with little support from member reps
</p>
<p>   
I have cherished my time as a season ticket holder and the memories it gave me with my dad. Unfortunately, these changes have made it clear that the Orioles no longer value partial plan members the way they once did.
Sincerely,
     
</p>
      <p>
        I am excited for the season ahead and I am ready to cheer. Let us make the next run
        one to remember.
      </p>

      <p>With respect,</p>
      <p>Mike Upman</p>
